Recommender system:
Recommend movies from MoviesLens dataset using collaborative filtering ( Single Value Decomposition - SVD).

Learn the featured vector for the movies and the users while filing the sparse matrix. Use the learned feature vector to cluster the data using k-means. Based on the user, we can recommend movies that is similar to the watched movies.
